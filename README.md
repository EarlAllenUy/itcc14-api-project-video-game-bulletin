## 🎯 Project Overview & Initial Deliverables

### 📝 Problem Statement

> Game enthusiasts often struggle to keep track of new and upcoming video game releases because information is scattered across numerous websites, social media, and news outlets. This fragmentation makes it difficult to find accurate, consolidated, and timely information. The **Video Game Bulletin (VGB)** addresses this by creating a centralized, streamlined, and reliable hub for all video game and console release information.

### 🌟 Project Goals

The primary goal is to develop a user-friendly, web-based platform that serves as a centralized hub for upcoming and newly released video game and console announcements.

The system aims to:
* Deliver concise and timely game release information to users.
* Provide a functional release calendar and real-time database updates for accuracy.
* Allow users to filter games by genre and search for releases.
* Support user interactive features like account creation, favoriting games, and commenting on releases.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
* **Database**: Firebase Firestore
* **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with bcrypt
* **API Architecture**: RESTful API
* **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

### 💾 Data Models

### 💻 Milestone 2: Core API Functionality & Integration (Nov Wk 3) 🚀

#### ✅ What we did

We implemented the essential **Read** and **Admin Write** operations to manage game content. This involved building the public endpoints (`/releases`, `/games/{id}`) and the administrative **CRUD** for game data. We also integrated the frontend to display this core data.

#### ✅ Deliverables (COMPLETED)

1. **Public Read Endpoints:** Working API endpoints for `GET /releases` and `GET /games/{id}`.
2. **Admin CRUD:** Full administrative **CRUD** functionality (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` for `/games`) implemented and tested against the database.
3. **Frontend Calendar:** The main landing page is built and successfully fetches/displays the list of games from the `/releases` endpoint.
4. **Seed Data:** A runnable **Seed Script** created to populate the database with sample data for demonstration.

#### ✅ Checklists (ALL COMPLETED)

- [x] Implement **GET /releases** and **GET /games/{id}** endpoints.

### 🔒 Milestone 3: User Interaction & Security (Nov Wk 4) 💬

#### ✅ What we did

This phase completed all user-facing interactive features, including **User Authentication**, **Role-Based Routing**, and foundational work for **Favoriting** and **Commenting** systems. The focus was on security, ensuring all endpoints are protected based on the user's role (Guest, Registered User, Admin). We implemented proper user authentication with JWT tokens and role-based page redirection.

#### ✅ Deliverables (COMPLETED)

1. **Authentication System:** Fully functional User Registration (`POST /api/users`) and Login/Logout functionality with JWT token management.
2. **Role-Based Routing:** Frontend now correctly redirects authenticated users to their appropriate dashboard:
   - **Admin users** → `admin_index.html`, `admin_calendar.html`, `admin_reviews.html`
   - **Regular users** → `user_index.html`, `user_calendar.html`, `user_reviews.html`
   - **Guest users** → `index.html`, `calendar.html`, `reviews.html`
3. **Security Implementation:** All Admin and Registered User modification endpoints are secured with JWT authentication middleware.
4. **Updated UI & UX:** Frontend forms and logic for user login, registration, and role-specific dashboards are fully functional.

#### ✅ Key Features Implemented

- ✅ User registration with password hashing (bcrypt)
- ✅ User login with JWT token generation
- ✅ Token storage in browser localStorage
- ✅ Role-based page redirect after login
- ✅ Dynamic UI updates based on authentication state
- ✅ Admin user identification (orange highlight)
- ✅ Regular user welcome messages (green highlight)
- ✅ Logout functionality with localStorage cleanup
- ✅ Modal-based login/signup forms with validation
- ✅ Authentication middleware (`verifyToken`, `isAdmin`)

#### ✅ Checklists (ALL COMPLETED)

- [x] Implement **User Registration** endpoint with validation.
- [x] Implement **User Login** endpoint with JWT token generation.
- [x] Implement **Logout** functionality with token cleanup.
- [x] Update **`auth-modal.js`** with redirect logic based on user roles.
- [x] Apply authentication middleware to secure relevant endpoints.
- [x] Update **`api.yaml`** with required security schemes documentation.
- [x] Build login/signup forms in frontend with error handling.
- [x] Store JWT token in localStorage and send with authenticated requests.
- [x] Implement role-based page redirection after authentication.
- [x] Test security rules to prevent unauthorized access.
- [x] Verify that admin users see admin dashboards.
- [x] Verify that regular users see user dashboards.
